# Health Calculator 

Proposed exercise 3.17 Chapter 3 from the book How to Program in Java by Paul Deitel.
A health calculator that the user enters their data and it returns the calculation of maximum heart rate, target heart rate, BMI and also the user's BMI classification.

(Computerization of health records) A health care issue discussed lately in news media
communication is the computerization of health records. This possibility is being approached cautiously because of concerns
concerns regarding the privacy and security of sensitive data, among other reasons. [We will discuss these concerns in exercises
later.] The computerization of health records can make it easier for patients to share their health profiles and histories among
several health professionals. This may improve the quality of medical care, help to avoid conflicts and wrong medication prescriptions.
medicines, reduce outpatient costs and save lives. In this exercise, you will design a “starter” HealthProfile class for a
person. Class attributes must include first name, last name, gender, date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for month, day
and year of birth), height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) of the person. Your class must have a constructor that receives this data.
For each attribute, provide set and get methods. The class must also include methods that calculate and return the user's age in years,
maximum heart rate range and target heart rate (see Exercise 3.16), plus body mass index (BMI; see
Exercise 2.33). Write a Java application that requests the person's information, instantiate an object of the HealthProfile class to
it and print the information from that object — including first name, last name, gender, date of birth, height and weight of the person ––, and
then calculate and print age in years, BMI, maximum heart rate range and target heart rate. It must also display
the graph of BMI values from Exercise 2.33
